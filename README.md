# LHSpython

LHSpython is a GUI tool, written using python3, tkinter and pandas,  which lets you browse Excel spreadsheets and converts it into a pandas dataFrame.

The pandas DataFrame is accessed using tkinter , which is simple and convenient.

The GUI app I have made allows the user to search and index through the DataFrame.At present, It is being used for a database of school students

Requirements - python3, tkinter , pandas
The python libraries can be installed using conda or pip, depending on your environment.

The input entries can be the student name , admission number or phone number. Only one entry is allowed at a time. If the entry does not exist, it shows an empty dataFrame.

Here are screenshots showing the Entries and results-
